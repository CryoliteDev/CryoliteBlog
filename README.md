# Cryolite Blog

The overall goal I had for this blog was to create a central place where people can get information regarding the latest tech that’s in the market or just general information regarding technology whether it be software, hardware or some technological advancements. In few days I’m planning on partnering up with one of my friends so we can work on this together and expand it. And hopefully in the next two or three weeks we will host so we can show case our portfolio with our daily blogs.

The main page of the website contains a list of the articles’ I have done so far with time stamps underneath each title. At the moment I have 4 articles on the website.
